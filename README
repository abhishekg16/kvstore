This the keyValue server README file

Assuing that $GOROOT, $GOPATH and $GOBIN variables are set

External dependency:
1. This implementation uses the zeromq. 
2. First install ZeroMQ 3.x.. This is available at http://zeromq.org/area:download . Please intall Stable Release 3.2.4.
3. Then install go lang binding extention using
	 go get -tags zmq_3_x github.com/alecthomas/gozmq



Files included
1. Server : zmq_server.go
2. Client : zmq_client.go
2. Server_Test : zmq_test.go


How to run 
1. go get github.com/abhishekg16/kvstore
2. go install github.com/abhishekg16/kvstore/client
3. go build github.com/abhishekg16/kvstore/server
4.Not the binary would have been installed in $GOPBIN/bin path. 
go to $GOBIN/bin
5 ./server
